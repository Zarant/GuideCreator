# GuideCreator

## Overview

This is an addon for classic WoW and classic TBC that assists in the creation of in-game leveling guides by auto generating a Guidelime text string every time you accept, turn in or complete quest objectives.

## Limitations

You need an english client for it to work, this addon relies on parsing text data to detect quest activity.

## Install

Download the .zip, locate your World of Warcraft folder and extract it in `_classic_beta_\Interface\AddOns` folder. Rename the `GuideCreator-classic-tbc` folder to `GuideCreator`.
